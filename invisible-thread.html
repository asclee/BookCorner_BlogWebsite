					<h2> <i>An Invisible Thread</i> </h2>
					<h3> By Laura Schroff and Alex Tresniowski <br />

				<p> I’ve read a lot of short stories about people helping others, but An Invisible Thread gives a full account of the lives of a saleswoman and a young boy on the streets. The book details a touching story about how she not only bought him food but also of how he repaid the favor with his smile and gratitude, paving the way for an unlikely friendship. </p>

				<p> Laura Schroff was a successful saleswoman in New York City when she first met Maurice, an 11-year-old boy begging on the streets, in 1986. That first meeting, she took Maurice to eat at a nearby McDonald’s. In the weeks and months that followed, Laura and Maurice continued meeting up, their acquaintance evolving into a full friendship that helped both of them. </p>

				<p> Scattered throughout the book are past memories from Laura’s and Maurice’s lives. These memories offer a view into the struggles that they went through and give light to the connection between their experiences. Laura came from a family with an alcoholic father, similar to how Maurice had an abusive father and a family of drug addicts. However, their relationship provides Maurice solace and safety from his difficult life while allowing Laura to cope with her past and care for another person. </p>

				<p> Laura and her coauthor Alex Tresniowski write with skill, and the book is simple yet beautiful. There are numerous bits of eloquence in the text where Laura pauses to reflect on her friendship with Maurice—the way it helped her see how fortunate she was and how far an act of human compassion can reach into one’s life. I couldn’t stop reading the book, and there were more than a few pages where I teared up, both from joy and sadness. An Invisible Thread gave me new insight into the kinds of pain and difficulty people can bear. The snapshots of the things Laura and Maurice have gone through made me realize all the comforts I should be grateful for in my own life. </p>

				<p> The characters in An Invisible Thread are vividly described, and each one plays an important role in the story of the main characters’ relationship. All the flashbacks, events, and settings combine into a single, well-written narrative. The further into the book I read, the more moved I was by how this wasn’t just fiction; this was a true story regarding the human condition and how powerful a friendship can be. I think a part of the book that stood out to me was where one of Laura’s colleagues gave clothes for Maurice after hearing Laura talk about Maurice. It was heartwarming to realize that the friendship between Laura and Maurice spread out to other people and brightened their lives too. </p>

				<p> An Invisible Thread is just an honest, touching book that I highly recommend. It’s really something to uplift one’s view of life and humanity, and it serves as a reminder of all that we have to be grateful for. </p>
				
				<p> <b>Rating:</b> 5 out of 5 stars </p>
