					<p> Erin Morgenstern is the author of <i>The Night Circus</i>, a fantasy book set in Victorian London. In the story, Celia and Marco are two young magicians who are pitted against each other in a contest of magical skills. This contest takes place in Le Cirque des Rêves, a circus that appears only at night for the public to enjoy. The only problem is that Celia and Marco fall in love as the competition unfolds into a duel where only one contestant can win. </p>

						<q>Only the ship is made of books, its sails thousands of overlapping pages, and the sea it floats upon is dark black ink.</q>
					</blockquote>
					
					<p id="clear"> <img src="Images/night-circus.jpg" alt="Erin Morgenstern" id="circus" /> I thought that Morgenstern’s writing style in <i>The Night Circus</i> was dreamy and intriguing. Morgenstern actually started the book for National Novel Writing Month, an annual challenge to write 50,000 words in November. I’d say that the end result of her NaNoWriMo project turned out pretty amazing. I was a bit surprised to learn that Morgenstern studied theatre and studio art rather than writing in college. </p>
					
					<blockquote>
						<q>The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.</q>
					</blockquote>
					
					<p> As of now, <i>The Night Circus</i> is Morgenstern’s only novel, but she is working on a new book. There’s no release date for the new novel yet, but in the meantime if you’ve already gone through <i>The Night Circus</i> and want more of the author’s writing, go check out her <a href="http://erinmorgenstern.com/writing/flax-golden/">Flax-Golden Tales</a> on her website. It’s a collection of 261 short stories, each ten sentences long, that go along with a photograph. These are a few of my favorite stories: </p>
