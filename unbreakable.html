				<p> To be honest, I’m usually not much of a fan for paranormal ghost fighter stuff, so I nearly decided not to read Unbreakable after looking at the summary inside the book. However, I thought I’d give Unbreakable a try since Kami Garcia, the author of this book, has also coauthored another series called Beautiful Creatures which I like. Plus, the praise for Unbreakable quoted from other famous authors on the book jacket got me. </p>

				<p> In the story, Kennedy Waters, the main character, starts out as an ordinary high school girl, but then one night she finds her mom dead in her house from heart failure. (I should mention that her father isn’t in the story; he left the family when Kennedy was much younger.) About a month later, Kennedy is attacked by a ghost and rescued by twin brothers Jared and Lukas, who claim to be ghosthunters. After that experience, the twin brothers tell Kennedy that a ghost actually killed her mother. Kennedy is pulled into a ghost-and-demon-busting group called the Legion, comprised of herself, Jared, Lukas, and two other ghosthunters, Alara and Priest. </p>

				<p> Unbreakable definitely was an exciting read that I couldn’t put down because of the fast-paced action scenes and romance (I’m a sucker for that stuff). Still, I feel as if the book didn’t completely live up to my expectations after seeing the quotes of praise on the book cover. The start of the book moved very quickly. All that summary I gave about Kennedy finding her mom dead and getting attacked by a ghost? It happened in just the first few chapters of the book. I thought that Kennedy’s mom was taken out of the book too early; I would have liked to see a lengthier, in-depth relationship between mother and daughter. The romance aspect of the book’s plot also seemed cliché and predictable, too similar to romances I’ve read in numerous other popular teen novels. </p>

				<p> Apart from these problems, I did like the ghost-slaying moves and equipment that the characters pull out in each action scene. The author also did a good job describing the settings and paranormal sides to each locale in the plot. I loved the characters of Alara, Priest, and Lukas. They have defined, multifaceted personalities that really come out through their actions and dialogue. By contrast, Kennedy’s personality was harder for me to pin down, and I thought the author relied too much on just telling rather than showing Jared’s traits. </p>

				<p> Overall, I really liked Unbreakable, but in the end it didn’t do much to distinguish itself from all the other typical teen fiction I’ve read. I would recommend the book if you fall as hard as I do for romance and thrilling action, but if you don’t prefer that kind of writing, this book probably isn’t for you. </p>
